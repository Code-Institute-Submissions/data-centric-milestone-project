#Your Project's Name
One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project.

Essentially, this part is your sales pitch.

##UX
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.


###User Stories:
'As a Game of Thrones fan I would like to see a website that displays a list of all of the main and recurring characters as there are too many to remember by heart and I would like to remeber names to faces. I would like the list displayed alphabetically so it is easy to look through and digest'

'As a user I would like to be able to easily discern which character belongs to which house so that it is easier to understand who are allies and distant relatives'

'As a fan of Game of Thrones, I would like to know, up to Season 7, which characters have been killed off. This is so I know what to expect from the final season'

'As a user I would like a 'live' website that will allow myself and others to add character infomation to it as the show still has not finished. It would be great to add any new/old characters and any info that someone else adding character info may have missed for referencing purposes for myself'

'As a Game of Thrones fan I would like to remember which house is in what region. I'd like the ability to visually see which house is where to understand which houses are allies'

'As a Game of Thrones fan, it would be great to see which characters appear in which seasons as there are so many to remember it would be good to know when they're introduced'

Mockups are situated in a folder named 'mockups'
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

##Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

##Existing Features
###Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

##Features Left to Implement

Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

##JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

##Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

##Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
